I am a postdoc research fellow at University of Exeter (UK). This website is my
informal blog where I intend to write short articles accessible to people with
some general scientific background but who are not necessarily experts in my
own field.  My primary research topic is the dynamics and evolution of
planetary interiors.  My main tool to do so is computational fluid dynamics.  I
use theoretical and numerical methods to modelize and simulate convection in
planetary contexts.  I am therefore interested in various branches of physics,
mathematics, and computer sciences, including but not limited to:

- *fluid mechanics*, the branch of continuum mechanics focused on the description
  and understanding of the behaviour of fluid materials;
- *rheology*, which is the relation between stress and deformation in a fluid;
- *thermodynamics*, the study of heat and energy transfers, and the relations
  between state variables;
- *partial differential equations*, to e.g.  express relations between physical
  quantities in a fluid;
- *dynamical systems theory*, a broad branch of mathematics interested in the
  evolution of generic time-dependent systems;
- *numerical integration* of differential equations, the branch of mathematics
  interested in algorithms to find approximate solutions of such equations;
- *programming paradigms* and how they can help (or not!) expressing elegant
  algorithms to solve numerical problems;
- *type systems* as a way to enforce invariants/guarantees in softwares.

Here is a (chaotic) list of miscellaneous tools I use and related links.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/), a high-level programming language with
  a rich ecosystem.
    - [numpy](https://numpy.org/), for fast and convenient ndarray manipulation
      and linear algebra.
    - [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html), a library of
      numerical routines built around numpy.
    - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), to plot your data
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a system programming language that
  manages to combine excellent performances, memory safety, and high-level
  abstractions thanks to a clever type system and ownership model.
    - The [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a great introduction
      to the language.
- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), the full-fledged typesetting system.
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), the famous editor that's available pretty much
  anywhere.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), a convenient open-source password
  manager.
- [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org/), a POSIX-compatible shell with great
  completion capabilities.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the stupid content tracker.
    - The [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a must-read for
      anyone using Git.
