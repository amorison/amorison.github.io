This is a place-holder article while I build this website.
Here is some `inline_code`, as well as a code block:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello world!");
}
```

I want to write some inline maths $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}$ and formulas
$$\frac{Df}{Dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol v\cdot\nabla f$$

Testing of **markdown** various *style*
